## My work:

### Problem answering
#### Problem 1 
• Based on the “bottleneck” intuition mentioned in the notes, why might a hard-coded human logic (e.g., if study hours > 5 then Pass) fail compared to a Machine Learning approach? 
-> Answer: Because the factors that affect the success rate are a lot, not only depending on time, but also determination, focus, or something else, so the number of variables are alot to consider, so it’ll be very complex.
• Why is a standard Linear Regression line potentially problematic for a discrete classification task? 
-> Answer: Because as input changes, the output is continuously changing and not fixed to a boolean
#### Problem 2
Answer: No, because they are not in the same dimension (axis system). 
V vector: let’s assume it’s the [100 I, 500 J], so i and j are measured by dollars
W vector: [5 i’, 90j’] with i'=1 hour and j' is 1 point
#### Problem 3
1. Point B (3, 13)
2. Vector: (3i, 13j)
#### Problem 4
1. c = 5
2. vector k <-6,-8>
