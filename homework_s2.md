## Problem 1
### Q
A transformation matrix M is defined by where it lands the basis vectors ˆi and ˆj. If a
transformation squishes the entire 2D plane onto a single line (e.g., the y-axis), what does
this tell you about the columns of the matrix?
If this matrix M represents a data processing step, can you ever perfectly recover the
original input X from the output Y ? Why or why not?

### A
1 of the matrix must be a 1d. We can not reverse it.

## Problem 2
M1(M(x)) khác M(M1(x)) ; the single point will destroy the whole transformation
